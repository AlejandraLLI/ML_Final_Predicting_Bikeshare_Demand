# ML_Final_Predicting_Bikeshare_Demand

This is the Github repository for the final project "Predicting Bikeshare Demand According to Climate Conditions" for the Machine Learning course (Autumn  2017). 

The aim of this project id to predict the number of bicycles rented per our according to climatic and environmental conditions for Bikeshare in Washington and compare the results obtained with different machine learning methods studied through the course. Data was recovered from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset )

The project was developed estimating  a linear regression, a Lasso regression, neural networks, random forest and gradient boosting machine. 

Note that all coding and comments are in Spanish. There is an html output for the project.
